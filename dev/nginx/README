# Nginx Config Files

The files in this directory can be used to configure a nginx reverse proxy for local development.
After installing Nginx they must be moved to it's root folder in /etc/hosts. This can be done with the following command:

>> cp -r nginx.conf sites-available/ /etc/nginx
>> cp -r nginx.conf sites-enabled/ /etc/nginx
# Nginx Cert Files
 
In order for Nginx HTTPS/WSS to work you must create a self-signed certificate. It can be done using the following command:

>> openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -keyout cert.key -out cert.crt

Now, place the two newly created files, e.g cert.key and cert.crt, in your nginx folder (/etc/nginx) and restart the service (systemctl restart nginx).
PS: There is more certificate related configuration at /dev/security/README.
